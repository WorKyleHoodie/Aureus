All 3 of our founders have spent years in the trenches writing software and still do it almost every single day. We know the only way to build the world&#x27;s best code editor is by equipping every single member of the team to do the best work of their career.<p>We&#x27;ve raised $42M to support our ultimate vision, a new way to collaborate on software, where conversations about code remain connected to the code itself, instead of being tied to aging snapshots or scattered across different tools.

All in support of security guards. We stay away from conflict, just robots driving circles around buildings in remote boring places. The technical challenges however, are far from boring.<p>We are looking for a full stack engineer to join as a core member of the off-robot software team. This is the software that plans, configures, operates and creates insights from data collected from the robots. You would work across the whole cloud-stack, consisting of Frontend (React), Backend (Typescript &#x2F; Go), Infra (Terraform &#x2F; AWS &#x2F; GCP).<p>The cloud software team is still small, meaning you get a chance to help set priorities, guide long-term architectural direction and figure out how to best help our users. We celebrate pragmatism, we work hard to make simple systems and we help each other to hyperfocus.<p>Sounds like the place for you? Drop an email to sijmen@ascento.ai. I&#x27;m curious to read what about this ad caught your interest."

We’re looking for two roles, from mid-senior to senior engineer with at least 5+ years of experience.<p>Backend:  Strong in backend development, ideally Java, but open to those willing to learn. DevOps experience is a plus, or a strong desire to build it.You’ll be expected to do devops as part of this role.<p>Fullstack: FE and APIs, you’ll also be asked to write SQL and some Java Controllers that access data. It’s ok if you don’t know Java, but our controllers are written in Java and you’ll need willingness to learn.<p>Our stack includes Java, Python, TypeScript, Angular, SQL, AWS, Kubernetes, Postgres, Trino, Flux, Flagger, and Terraform.<p>Our engineers must be able to think product-first, and take a task from idea to production, work across the full cycle. You must write your own code, AI assistance is fine, but you must be able to produce all your work independently.<p>We are looking for candidates that can write SQL, our approach when it comes to the DB is SQL first. We also value clear thinking and communication, you should be comfortable sketching simple architecture or flow diagrams (boxes and lines, nothing formal) to explain your ideas.<p>To apply, please send an email to jack[at]splash.tech with the subject “Backend Hackernews 2025” or “Fullstack Hackernews 2025”.<p>Please send any git&#x2F;bitbucket&#x2F;source-forge project that represents your coding otherwise I’ll ask you to complete a small test project."
